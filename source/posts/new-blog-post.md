# How instructors can prepare students for online assessments

Remote learning has been full of challenges, but preparing for an exam or online quiz shouldn’t be one of them.

Students will naturally be apprehensive when they approach their first online assessment. Still, as the educator, your goal should be to help them develop a full understanding of the technology so that you can guide them through the material and the test-taking process.

Fortunately, when you use a digital grading tool like Crowdmark, understanding any online quiz or assignment mechanics is easy. In this article, we’ll show you how to prepare students virtually for any assignment, from online quizzes to in-person exams.

## Preparing students virtually for their next online assessment

There are many different ways for educators to prepare students for online assessments. Here are some of our top suggestions for introducing new technology and new assessment forms into your online classroom.

### Use the technology early and often

1. Ideally, the technology you’re using to administer the online assignments shouldn’t be new to your students. Introducing new technology on the day of a big assignment or exam is a lot for students to handle.
2. Instead, try to make sure that students are familiar with the technology before their exam. An excellent way to do this is by allowing them to practice in low-stakes situations.
3. Ensuring they feel comfortable with the platform makes it easier for them to focus on their study material rather than getting distracted trying to familiarize themselves with a new testing method.

### Open your inbox to questions

To help students feel more familiar with the online assessment format, encourage them to ask for help when they need it. It’s much easier for you to deal with questions in advance, rather than fielding dozens of frantic questions on the day of the online quiz or exam. You can do this over email or set up video sessions on certain days where students can drop in and ask questions.

### _Double check_ your exam formatting

[Creating a remote exam](https://crowdmark.com/help/creating-a-remote-exam/) on Crowdmark is simple, and the formats are endlessly customizable. Educators can create an assignment by uploading an existing document or using markdown formatting to build it from scratch. In the end, make sure to preview your assessment both digitally and on paper to see how it will appear when students go to fill it in.

### Provide time management suggestions

Whether you plan to proctor the exam in person or administer it online, you can help students by providing time management suggestions throughout the assessment. If you’re in-person, this could be done verbally. If students are taking the quiz or test online, you can place the suggested time breakdown at the top or throughout each section to encourage them to use their allotted time wisely.

### Offer a grading breakdown

Before students sit down for their assessment, they should understand the grading criteria and what level of knowledge they will be expected to demonstrate. This will help keep them motivated and focused throughout the examination process.

## Keep online quiz and exam preparation simple with Crowdmark

Preparing students for important exams and assessments virtually is hard enough. Designing the assessment and grading each paper shouldn’t be an additional drain on your already limited time.

To help make these critical tasks less time-consuming, try a digital grading tool like Crowdmark.
